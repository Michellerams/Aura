## üí° User Interaction & Data Flow

Aura follows a **simple, unidirectional data flow model**, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.

1. **User Action** ‚Äì The user enters text or uses the Speech-to-Text feature to submit a prompt.  
2. **State Update** ‚Äì The input is sent to the central `App` component for state management.  
3. **API Call** ‚Äì The `App` component triggers `geminiService.ts` to send the prompt to the Gemini API.  
4. **Streaming Response** ‚Äì `geminiService.ts` receives the response in small chunks (streaming response chunks).  
5. **Real-time Rendering** ‚Äì The `App` component updates the application state and the `ChatWindow` component renders the new message chunks in real-time, creating a smooth "typing" effect.
